However i have now found a use for both and are running in my office performaing their various functions. </p>\n<p>The RPi3b does multi duty in that it run a PiHole DNS protection system and also a Web host for small scale web hosting. I have just moved over to NGINX as the Web server as this allows easy Hosting and also straight forward Proxy to a different internal server. </p>\n<p>The reason for this is that the RPi4 hosts a Java Minecraft Server and a controle panel call Pterodactyl. Pterodcactyl, once installed allows quick and easy creation of games servers through the use of Eggs. It is possible to have multiple users assigned to a server and allows that server to be carved up into multiple servers running different worlds. </p>\n<p>Each Server is run under Docker and is all handles by the Pterodactyl software and provices a nice user interface to manage the server and upload Add ons, much like DynMap. </p>\n<p>Phantom - A Minecraft Proxy solution to allow devices like the Xbox, Switch and other devices that dont allow the user to manually add Microsoft servers for them to show up on the LAN screen as if they were hosted on the local LAN.  </p>",
